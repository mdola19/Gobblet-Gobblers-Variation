# Gobblet-Gobblers-Variation
After learning some basics of Computer Science in the grade 12 course, ICS4U0, I created a themed version of a tic tac toe variation called Gobblet Gobblers. This was one of my first projects with Android Studio and the Java programming language overall. The focus of this project was to learn these new tools while using problem solving and creative thinking to perform complex actions in the game with basic logic (conditional statements, arrays, and loops).

### Game Description:
As playued in the board game Gobblet Gobblers, there are 3 sizes of pieces that can be placed on a tile. Larger pieces can be placed on top of smaller ones. The first person to get three in a row of any size wins. This specific app is a basketball themed version called "Hoop. Ball. Slam." where the game pieces are a hoop, baswketball, and player dunking the ball. The hoop is the smallest piece, followed by the ball and player dunking.

### Basic Logic:
The game is to be played on a 3x3 grid so I decided to use a simple 2D Array to store the information for each tile which is manipulated throughout the game. This seems pretty inefficient in terms of expanding it to larger playing boards but given the beginner level of this project, this method was sufficient in achieving the desired resutls. In the future, more sophisticated manipulation of the arrays can be developed to improve the logic. The rest of the code is just appropriately displaying UI elements and enforcing the rules of the game.

### Tools Used:
- **Android Studio** - The tool used to develop the app
- **Java** - The programming language used to code the logic of the app
